# React.js project starter
Basic starter with live-reloading and PostCSS

## What's included
Nothing besides React and ReactDOM. This isn't your server-side rendering, reduxified, "depends on a bajillion modules" starter. This is for getting off the ground running as fast as possible with zero config.

## Get started
Open your terminal and run `yarn install && npm run dev`
